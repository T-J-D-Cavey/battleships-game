# üö¢ Battleships: Commander of the Seas

This is a browser-based, client side Battleships game built to explore the efficiency and quality of code generated by modern AI design tools. The goal was to see how far a developer with basic skills could get using tools like Vercel v0, Gemini, and various other AI platforms. The full journey and analysis will be available [on my blog](https://my-web-dev-blog.vercel.app/).

## üöÄ The AI-Accelerated Project

This project was developed primarily using AI-generated code, with the majority of the foundation laid by **Vercel v0**. The subsequent **debugging, refactoring, and custom asset integration were guided by Google Gemini**.

### Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
* **Language:** TypeScript (Generated by v0)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Deployment:** Vercel

### Key Features

* **Full Gameplay Loop:** Place ships, alternate turns, process hits/misses.
* **Responsive Design:** Playable on desktop and mobile.
* **Ship Placement:** Supports horizontal and vertical placement.
* **Persistence:** Game state is saved in `localStorage` across browser refreshes during mid-battle.
* **Custom UI:** Features a custom naval/radar-themed interface using custom assets and Tailwind glow effects.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

1.  **Deployment:** Deploy your fleet on your Home Sea Zone.
2.  **Fire:** Click a tile in the Enemy Sea Zone to select a target. Click the target again (or the Fire Guns button) to confirm the shot.
3.  **Opponent's Turn:** The view switches to your Home Sea Zone while the opponent takes their shot.
4.  **Victory:** The game ends when either the enemy Battleship is sunk, or all of one side's Destroyers are destroyed.

## Bugs / enhancements to fix

* Images aren't using Next.js Image component 
* Page changes aren't using Next.js Link component
* Reset deployment button on position-ships page has a bug with hover border on wide desktop screens
* Enhancement: make it more dificult, the bot gets two random grid shots per round
* End reason on results page isn't accurate. We might want to store and retrieve the results from local storage
